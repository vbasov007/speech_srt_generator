Our application can now handle Cypress registrations from Salesforce.
I'll show you how it works in a short video.
So, let's go to the application page.
#2000
Choose a region.
Now there are two buttons to process new registrations.
The first is processing IDIS registrations.
I have already shown you how to work with this.
If you want to refresh, please watch the training video.
The second button is Cypress registration processing.
Press it and wait a few seconds.
#5000
You can see a table with new registrations.
The system has already processed them and left comments.
Green lines show the registrations for which there are no registrations from other distributors for that particular customer.
Yellow lines show cases where there may be an overlap with another distributor.
For example another distributor has already received registrations for the same product family.
#2000
I suggest that you start by looking up client names in the synonyms column.
Click Add/Remove to edit the list of synonym names.
#2000
You can use the asterisk symbol in the search field to replace any number of characters.
#3000
Add and remove names by clicking Add and Remove next to the client names.
#2000
If changes are made to the synonym data, you must restart registration processing because changes in synonyms may change the result of this operation for some registrations.
#2000
select the values in the drop-down menus.
When you click on the system recommendation text, it is automatically copied to the menu.
#5000
If you click on the name of a customer, tables with all the registrations related to that customer appear.
If necessary, you can unload any table in excel format.
The search field in the upper right corner allows you to filter values in the table by text in any column.
#2000
Let's return to the table with the new registrations.
When all fields are filled in, click Submit button at the bottom of the table.
#2000
Your decisions for each registration are saved and will be sent to SFDC at the end of the day.
You can edit and Submit as many times as you want before the data is uploaded to SFDC.
#2000
That's all for now, feel free to ask questions and provide feedback on the application!
