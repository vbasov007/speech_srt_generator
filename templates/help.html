        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    - Create a plain text containing the script you want to convert.<br>
    - Each line in the text file represents a subtitle caption, which will appear on the screen as one caption.<br>
    - Ensure that each subtitle caption fits within a reasonable length to fit on the screen.<br>
    - You can add additional pauses between sentences: add a line starting with "#" followed by the duration in milliseconds.<br>
            For example, "#2000" represents a 2000ms or 2s pause.<br>
    - We recommend adding pauses between sentences where the scenario assumes change of screen or action which has duration.<br>
    - The pauses can be easily cut out from the final video.<br><br>
    - Type or copy and paste the script into the text area below.<br>
    - Select the language and voice you want to use.<br>
    - Click on "Generate and Download File" button.<br>
    - The generated files in zip-archived form will be downloaded to your computer.<br><br>
