It's useful to start a video script with some extra lines that will be removed later, to help with synchronization with the video's start.
For instance, you could include a countdown like:

3
2
1

Always insert pauses between the lines like in the line below:
#2000
They assist you in keeping pace with the voice-over during video recording.
Unnecessary pauses can be easily removed from the completed video in any video editor.
To insert pauses between lines, write a code of form #2000 on a separate line. The number represents the pause duration in milliseconds.
In this way, #2000 corresponds to a 2-second pause. #3500 would be 3.5-second pause.
You can specify the exact time for any line to kick in.
For that, you use codes such as "#00:05:30,500" on a separate line.
This indicates that the next line will start precisely 5 minutes and 30.5 seconds from the beginning of the video.

Use Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) when necessary.
It helps in pronouncing abbreviations, speaking words in a different language, or creating a pause within a sentence.
Supported SSML tags match to Amazon AWS Polly rules.

See some examples:

Hello there.&ltbreak time="2s"/&gt How are you today?
I can speak French. &ltlang xml:lang="fr-FR"&gtJe ne parle pas français.&lt/lang&gt
You say, &ltphoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="pɪˈkɑːn"&gtpecan&lt/phoneme&gt.
I say, &ltphoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpi.kæn"&gtpecan&lt/phoneme&gt.
2 devided by 9 is pronounced &ltsay-as interpret-as="fraction"&gt2/9&lt/say-as&gt.
&ltsay-as interpret-as="characters"&gtICP&lt/say-as&gt is the abbreviation for Infineon Cloud Platform.
